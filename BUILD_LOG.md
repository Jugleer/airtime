# BUILD_LOG.md — Orchestrator Ledger

Append-only record of the phased build. Owned by the orchestrator (builders do not
edit this file). See ORCHESTRATOR_PROMPT.md for the protocol.

## Phase 0 — Scaffold            DONE
- Date: 2026-07-08
- Commit: b67faa5
- Gate: (2026-07-08, "npm run gate", green — typecheck ok, lint ok, 9 test files / 18 tests passed in 2.1 s, vite build ok, 192 kB bundle / 61 kB gzip; run independently by orchestrator, not taken from builder report)
- Builder deviations from plan:
  - Playwright NOT removed: `npx playwright install chromium` succeeded on this arm64 Ubuntu 20.04 box and a headless launch smoke test passed. `@playwright/test` kept as devDependency; no e2e config/spec dir/script yet (Playwright is not part of the gate) — the first visual phase that wants e2e adds the harness.
  - Single `tsconfig.json` instead of the Vite template app/node split; strictness beyond `strict` (noUncheckedIndexedAccess, noImplicitReturns, noUnusedLocals/Params, verbatimModuleSyntax).
  - ESLint uses non-type-checked tseslint configs (lint speed on the Jetson; boundary rules need no type info).
- Decisions made (reversible forks):
  - Orchestrator: renamed branch `master` → `main` (GitHub default; Phase 9 deploys Pages from main). Created public repo https://github.com/Jugleer/airtime (user approved); pushing after each phase.
  - Versions resolved to mid-2026 latest: React 19.2, three 0.185, r3f 9.6, drei 10.7, zustand 5.0, TypeScript 6.0, Vite 8.1, Vitest 4.1, ESLint 10 (flat), fast-check 4.8. React 19 pinned to r3f v9 peer requirement.
- Deferred items:
  - eslint-plugin-react-hooks / react-refresh — add when React component logic lands (Phase 3+).
  - Coverage wired (`test:coverage`, v8 provider, scoped to src/core/**) but not part of the gate; Phases 1–2 use it for their ≥ 90 % core coverage bar.
  - Playwright e2e harness (config + spec dir + script) — first visual phase that wants it.
- Operator visual checks pending: n/a (builder verified `npm run dev -- --host` serves the placeholder page with LAN URLs)
- Orchestrator verification notes: core-boundary lint rule probed independently (violating file in src/core → 3 errors, exit 1); orchestrator-owned docs untouched by builder; no builder commits (all work arrived as working-tree changes, as instructed).
